# Self-Driving-Cars-With-Carla
This repository contains work done on self-driving-car with carla project.

I think i am going to use image-segmentation to segment training images and then train a behavioural cloning model from nvidia research paper on those images to get the steering angle.         
Then i will work on pedal and braking system with another model later.     
Anyways here are the image_segmentation model test images.     
By no means u should think that i have made this model by myself XD. I have just used a pretrained image_segmentation model (Resnet-50).
